# CogLang Sub-Project:  GerMalKorSwa

Source languages:  German + Malay + Korean + Swahili, with influence weightings in that order too.

Output word list:  [output.txt](https://github.com/hchiam/cognateLanguage/blob/master/miniExamples/germalkorswa/output.txt)

Following the same process as that of the ["Cognate Language" project](https://github.com/hchiam/cognateLanguage), this is a mini test version to create a word list to serve as a mnemonic tool for a few other languages of interest.

# Notes

| Speakers: |   Language    |
| ---       |   ---         |
|   127m	|   German      |
|   170m    |   Malay       |
|   67m	    |   Korean      |
|   50m		|   Swahili     |

With respect to [MalKorSwaJapa](https://github.com/hchiam/cognateLanguage/tree/master/miniExamples/malKorSwaJapa) and [GerPorPol](https://github.com/hchiam/cognateLanguage/tree/master/miniExamples/gerPorPol):

 * I've included German to serve as an "anchor" in remembering the words--it seems that in the main CogLang project that having words from languages *I* already knew well helps as an extra backup "partial cognate" for mnemonics purposes. 
 * I've decided to combine MalKorSwaJapa and GerPorPol.  Languages were omitted due to a combination of lower number of speakers, lexical similarity with languages in the main CogLang project, and/or personal preference to try to limit the number of source languages (7 -> 4).

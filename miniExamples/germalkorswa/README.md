# CogLang Sub-Project:  GerMalKorSwa

Source languages:  German + Malay + Korean + Swahili, with influence weightings in that order too.  I've included German to serve as an "anchor" in remembering the words--it seems that in the main CogLang project that having words from languages I already knew well helps as an extra backup for mnemonics. 

Speakers:   Language
    127m	    German
    170m	    Malay
    67m		    Korean
    50m		    Swahili

Output word list:  [output.txt](https://github.com/hchiam/cognateLanguage/blob/master/miniExamples/germalkorswa/output.txt)

Following the same process as that of the ["Cognate Language" project](https://github.com/hchiam/cognateLanguage), this is a mini test version to create a word list to serve as a mnemonic tool for a few other languages of interest.

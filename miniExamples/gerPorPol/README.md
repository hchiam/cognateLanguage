# CogLang Sub-Project:  GerPorPol

Source languages:  German + Portuguese + Polish

Output word list:  [output.txt](https://github.com/hchiam/cognateLanguage/blob/master/miniExamples/gerPorPol/output.txt)

Following the same process as that of the ["Cognate Language" project](https://github.com/hchiam/cognateLanguage), this is a mini test version to create a word list to serve as a mnemonic tool for a few other languages of interest.

In this sub-project, there are only 3 source languages.  So with the current word-creation algorithm, this guarantees at most 3 vowels or vowel clusters (+ an unlikely initial vowel cluster for ease of pronunciation in rare cases, as seen in the main "CognateLanguage" Project).

Memrise course under construction, with some sound files:  [http://www.memrise.com/course/1225678/gerporpol/](http://www.memrise.com/course/1225678/gerporpol/)

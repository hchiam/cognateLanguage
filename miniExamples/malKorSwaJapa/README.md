# CogLang Sub-Project:  MalKorSwaJapa

Source languages:  Malay + Korean + Swahili + Japanese.

Output word list:  [output.txt](https://github.com/hchiam/cognateLanguage/blob/master/miniExamples/malKorSwaJapa/output.txt)

Following the same process as that of the ["Cognate Language" project](https://github.com/hchiam/cognateLanguage), this is a mini test version to create a word list to serve as a mnemonic tool for a few other languages of interest.

Also similar to the CognateLanguage project, the Memrise course corresponding to this sub-project is [here](http://www.memrise.com/course/1198396/malkorswajapa/).

# CogLang Sub-Project: Proto-Cog-Lang

Output word list: [output.txt](https://github.com/hchiam/cognateLanguage/blob/master/miniExamples/protoCogLang/output.txt)

Following the same process as that of the ["Cognate Language" project](https://github.com/hchiam/cognateLanguage), this is a mini test version to create a word list to serve as a mnemonic tool for a few other languages of interest, but this one uses *[proto-languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-language)*.
